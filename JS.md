## JS

### A seperation of concerns

- HTML - content

- CSS - presentation

- JS - behavior

`document.write('Good afternoon!');`

- document = the document oject. This represents the whole web page.

- . = the member operator. This is how you specify methods and properties, known as members of that object.

- write = a method within the document object.

- 'Good afternoon!' = a parameter within the write method.

- ; = closing the argument.

### Data Types

- strings = "some text" or 'some text'

- number = 40 or 100

- variable = way to store data. Described by var. For instance, var someWord = 'cool';

- boolean = TRUE or FALSE. Period.

- function

- array

- undefined

### Operators

Example: `10 + '10';`

- An example of type coercion. Will output `1010` On all ifs, force strong evaluation by using `===`.

- In 301, we're required to use `use strict;` which means if we don't use `===`, code won't run.

`'some ' + 'cool' + 'thing'`

- An example of concatenation

`var first = 'noah';`

`var last = 'rhodes';`

`console.log(first + ' ' + last);`

- An example of variable based concatenation
