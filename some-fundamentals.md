## Markdown - What is it?

Markdown is a fairly simple way to make text come to life. By using various *special characters*, you can make __emphasis__, change font size, add links and pretty much do anything you'd like.

### Uses and limitations

Essentially, anything you would like to do format text, you can do through markdown. [Here's a cheat sheet](https://help.github.com/en/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax). [You can even add emoji](https://www.webfx.com/tools/emoji-cheat-sheet/) using special codes.

You cannot, however, expect a what-you-see-is-what-you-get Word style experience, at least not exclusively with markdown. Font and color are controlled through the arcane nature of html and css. Once I get a firm handle on that, I'm sure I'll be appending this little how to guide as we progress.
