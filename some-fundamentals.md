## Markdown - What is it?

Markdown is a fairly simple way to make text come to life. By using various *special characters*, you can make __emphasis__, change font size, add links and pretty much do anything you'd like to format text.

### Uses and limitations

Essentially, anything you would like to do format text, you can do through markdown. [Here's a cheat sheet](https://help.github.com/en/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax). [You can even add emoji](https://www.webfx.com/tools/emoji-cheat-sheet/) using special codes.

You cannot, however, expect a what-you-see-is-what-you-get Word style experience, at least not exclusively with markdown. Font and color are controlled through the arcane nature of html and css. Once I get a firm handle on that, I'm sure I'll be appending this little how to guide as we progress.

## What's up with GitHub Pages?

GitHub pages is a way to build out a snazzy public face for you, your projects, or anything you're passionate about. Using GitHub Pages, you can make yourself look good and explain what the heck it is you've been doing to all those friends of yours who aren't particularly interested in investing mind-numbing numbers of hours on code stuff and wonder why you aren't hanging out with them much anymore. It's because I'm excercising mah brain space bruh. Time to get \#brainswole
