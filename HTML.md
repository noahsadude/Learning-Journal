### HTML

### Markup provides content with structure

#### Display types:

-Block display type *takes up 100% of the width of the page.* Can be moved up, down, left and right.

-Inline display type *takes up only the width of the elements within.* Can be only moved left or right. 

##### HTML5 -> Semantic markup structures 

<header>
<nav>
<main>
<article>
<footer>
<aside>
<section>

Basic form validation - Empty forms, email validation built-in

Attributes are key/value pairs that provide meta information - more information about that element
class attribute. One key, multiple values. E.g. class = "active cool", not class="active" class="cool"

The difference between h1 and h2 is purely importance.
The difference between an ol and ul is denoting the need to showcase steps in some fashion.

#### Brian's observations
-<table> is meant purely for tabular data. Do not make layouts with <table>
-One h1 per page. Please. Teh SEO.
-THE GODS WILL SMITE YOU IF YOU USE INLINE CSS.
-Do not capitalize your elements. People will see this and hate you.
